The only fully opensource software package providing a complete pipeline from
medical image data segmentation to patient specific blood flow simulation and
analysis.

SimVascular is an interactive application used to create patient-specific
geometric models of human vasculature from 3D medical imaging data acquired for
a specific anatomical region. These models are then used as the basis for blood
flow simulations using various numerical methods.
