# FindPythonLibs
# --------------
#
# Find python libraries
#
# This module finds if Python is installed and determines where the
# include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
# the library is.  This code sets the following variables:
#
# ::
#
#   PYTHON_FOUND           - have the Python libs been found
#   PYTHON_LIBRARIES           - path to the python library
#   PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH        - path to where Python.h is found (deprecated)
#   PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS        - path to where Python.h is found
#   PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES     - path to the debug library (deprecated)
#   PYTHON_VERSION_STRING  - version of the Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)
#
#
#
# The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list
# of version numbers that should be taken into account when searching
# for Python.  You need to set this variable before calling
# find_package(PythonLibs).
#
# If you'd like to specify the installation of Python to use, you should
# modify the following cache variables:
#
# ::
#
#   PYTHON_LIBRARY             - path to the python library
#   PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR         - path to where Python.h is found
#
# If calling both ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` and
# ``find_package(PythonLibs)``, call ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` first to
# get the currently active Python version by default with a consistent version
# of PYTHON_LIBRARIES.
