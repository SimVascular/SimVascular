// The sv4guiROMSimulationPreferences class is used to determine which default binaries,
// (svsolver, svpre and svpost) are used by the SV Simulation plugin. The class also 
// determines which mpiexec binary is used to execute solver jobs using MPI and what
// its implementation is: MPICH or OpenMPI. 
//
// An sv4guiROMSimulationPreferences object is used by the sv4guiSimulationPreferencePage objectc
// to display the full path to these binaries in the Preferences -> SimVascular Simulation panel.
//
// The sv4guiSimulationView object, used to lauch simulation jobs, only reads values from 
// the sv4guiSimulationPreferencePage object when a value is changed. Because of this the 
// sv4guiSimulationView object must also use a sv4guiROMSimulationPreferences object to set
// the default solver binaries.
